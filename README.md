esting the implementation of the BML https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.14778/3231751.3231759 algorithm using HLL and MinHash datasketches http://ekzhu.com/datasketch/index.html

The results of the tests in the root folder are already saved in the "results" folder, but if you want to run the tests by yourself:
